<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. 
It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, 
“process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information. It tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects 
you. We are committed to protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not just an exercise in 
complying with the law,  but a continuation of our respect for you and your personal information. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality
of all information you  provide to us, and  hope that you reciprocate.</p>
<p>Our policy complies with the Data Protection Act 2018 (Act) accordingly incorporating the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. 
We do this now,  by requesting that you read the information provided at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org">http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org</a> Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.</p>

<h4>Data we process</h4>
<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you. We have collated these into groups as follows:
Your identity includes information such as first name, last name, title, date of birth, and other identifiers that you may have provided at some 
time. Your contact information includes information such as billing address, delivery address, email address, telephone numbers and any other 
information you have given to us for the purpose of communication or meeting. Your financial data includes information such as your bank 
account and payment card details.</p>
<p>Transaction data includes details about payments or communications to and from you and information about products and services you have

and survey responses. Marketing data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us; communication preferences; responses and
actions in relation to your use of our services. We may aggregate anonymous data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. 
Anonymous data is data that does  not identify you as an individual. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not 
considered personal information in law because it does not reveal your identity.</p>
<p>For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in a product or service. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data 
with your personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we treat the combined data as personal information and it will be used in

opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.It also includes information about criminal

requested, we may not be able to perform that contract. In that case, we may have to stop providing a service to you. If so, we will notify you 
of this at the time.</p>

<h4>The bases on which we process information about you</h4>
<p>The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify
you of the basis for  each category. If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately 
stop processing your data. If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we 
have determined that  we can continue to process your information.</p>

<p>When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is 
formed between you and us.In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of

into a legal contract. We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under
the terms of the contract.</p>

<p>If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.</p>
<p>If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.
Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who 
posted the content that offends you. If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.</p>

<h4>Information relating to your method of payment</h4>
<p>We store information about your debit or credit card or other means of payment when you first provide it to us.</p>
<p>We store this payment information [at your request] in order to make repeat purchasing of goods and services easier next time you visit 
our website.</p>

<h4>We take the following measures to protect your payment information:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We keep your payment information encrypted on our servers.</li>
<li>We do not keep all your payment information so as:</li>
<li>to prevent the possibility of our duplicating a transaction without a new instruction from you;</li>

<li>Access to your payment information is restricted to authorised staff only.</li>
<li>If we ask you questions about your payment information, we only show partial detail, so that you can identify the means of payment to

according to our instructions. We keep this information only for the duration of the direct debit arrangement.</p>
<p>We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme. This provides for the customer's bank to refund disputed payments without 
question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved originators of direct 
debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give 
indemnity guarantees through their banks.</p>

contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give 
information, and if we do, what that information is.</p>

could identify you or any other person.</p>
